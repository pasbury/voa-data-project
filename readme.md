This project illustrates the typical stages in the process to build a machine learning model to perform a regression task.  There are currently three Jupyter notebooks covering:

1. Initial data processing and exploratory analysis
2. Data visualisation
3. Creating a machine learning model

The main packages used are: pandas, geopandas, LightGBM and scikit-learn.

## Data

The main data source for this analysis is a list of the rateable values of 2 million commercial properties in England and Wales.  This data is maintained and provide by the Valuation Office Agency.  The VOA is an executive agency of the UK government responsible for providing the valuations and property advice needed to support taxation and benefits.  The data can be downloaded [here](https://voaratinglists.blob.core.windows.net/html/rlidata.htm).

In addition, a shapefile of postal areas for England and Wales was obtained from Crone, James. (2017). GB Postcode Areas, [Dataset]. University of Edinburgh. https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/1755
